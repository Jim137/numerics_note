# Notes of Numerical Recipes

This repository is my notes of Numerical Recipes 3rd Edition authored by William H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling, and Brian P. Flannery.

This is for my personal use.

The original code is C++ code. I will translate it into Python code as my practice and understanding.
